## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Overview of Joining Processes
Processes that create a permanent joint between parts.
- **Welding**: Melts the base metal, often with a filler metal, to form a strong joint upon cooling.
- **Brazing**: Joins metals using a filler metal that melts *above* 450°C but *below* the base metal's melting point. The joint is formed by capillary action. Stronger than soldering.
- **Soldering**: Similar to brazing, but the filler metal (solder) melts *below* 450°C. Creates a weaker joint, often used for electrical connections.
- **Adhesive Bonding**: Uses chemical adhesives to bond materials.

### 2. Welding Processes

#### A. Fusion Welding (Liquid State)
*The base metal is melted to form the joint.*

- #### Arc Welding
  *Uses an electric arc to create heat. Key concepts include consumable vs. non-consumable electrodes, shielding (gas/flux), and power polarity.*
    - **SMAW (Shielded Metal Arc Welding)**: "Stick welding." Uses a consumable electrode coated in flux.
    - **GMAW (Gas Metal Arc Welding / MIG)**: Uses a continuous, consumable wire electrode and a separate shielding gas.
    - **FCAW (Flux-Cored Arc Welding)**: Similar to MIG, but the consumable wire electrode has a flux core.
    - **GTAW (Gas Tungsten Arc Welding / TIG)**: Uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode and a separate shielding gas. Produces high-quality welds.
    - **SAW (Submerged Arc Welding)**: The arc is "submerged" under a blanket of granular flux, which becomes a protective slag layer.
    - **PAW (Plasma Arc Welding)**: A very hot, constricted plasma arc is used. A variant of TIG.

- #### Resistance Welding
  *Uses heat generated from electrical resistance, combined with pressure.*
    - **Spot Welding**: Joins overlapping sheets at specific points.
    - **Seam Welding**: Uses rotating wheel electrodes to create a continuous leak-proof seam.
    - **Projection Welding**: Joins parts with pre-formed projections where the weld is localized.

- #### Gas Welding (Oxy-fuel Welding)
  *Uses heat from the combustion of a fuel gas (like acetylene) with oxygen.*
    - **Oxy-acetylene Welding (OAW)**: The most common type.
    - **Flame Types**:
        - **Neutral**: Balanced oxygen/acetylene ratio. For most steels.
        - **Oxidizing**: Excess oxygen. For copper and brass.
        - **Carburizing (Reducing)**: Excess acetylene. For high-carbon steel and hard-facing.

- #### Thermo-chemical Welding
    - **Thermit Welding**: Uses an exothermic reaction of aluminum powder and a metal oxide to produce superheated molten metal, which acts as both heat source and filler. Used for very heavy sections (e.g., railway tracks).

- #### Radiant Energy Welding (High Energy)
    - **Electron Beam Welding (EBW)**: Uses a high-velocity beam of electrons to create heat.
    - **Laser Beam Welding (LBW)**: Uses a focused laser beam as the heat source.

#### B. Solid-State Welding
*Joining occurs below the melting point of the base metals, using pressure.*
- **Friction Welding**: Heat is generated by rotating one component against another.
- **Friction Stir Welding (FSW)**: A non-consumable rotating tool is moved along the joint line, plasticizing and mixing the material.
- **Diffusion Welding**: Joins parts by applying pressure at an elevated temperature, causing atoms to diffuse across the interface.
- **Ultrasonic Welding**: Uses high-frequency ultrasonic vibrations and moderate pressure.

### 3. Weld Joints & Defects

-   **Weld Joint Types**: The configuration of the parts being joined.

    -   Butt, Lap, Corner, Tee, Edge.

-   **Weld Types**: The specific geometry of the weld bead.

    -   Bead weld, Fillet weld, Plug weld, Groove weld, Spot weld, Seam weld.

-   **Common Welding Defects**:

    -   **Cracks**: Hot cracks, cold cracks.

    -   **Porosity**: Gas pockets trapped in the solidified weld metal.

    -   **Inclusions**: Non-metallic materials (e.g., slag, oxides) trapped in the weld.

    -   **Incomplete Fusion**: Failure of the weld metal to fuse completely with the base metal or with previous weld passes.

    -   **Poor Penetration**: Lack of penetration into the joint root.

    -   **Undercut**: A groove melted into the base metal adjacent to the weld toe, weakening the joint.

    -   **Underfill**: Insufficient weld metal, resulting in a depression below the desired weld profile.

    -   **Overlap**: Weld metal flowing over the surface of the base metal without fusing.

    -   **Spatter**: Small droplets of weld metal expelled during welding that adhere to the base metal.

    -   **Dimensional**: Warpage, incorrect profile.
