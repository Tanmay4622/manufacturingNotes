### Metal Casting Processes
**Definition:** Metal casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solidified part is also known as a casting, which is then ejected or broken out of the mold to complete the process.

*   **Sand casting:** A casting process that uses sand as the mold material. It is economical and versatile, suitable for a wide range of metals and part sizes.
*   **Sand moulds:** Molds made from sand, typically a mixture of sand, clay (as a binder), and water. They are usually temporary and destroyed after each casting.
*   **Type of patterns:** A pattern is a replica of the object to be cast, used to create the mold cavity.
    *   **Single-piece (Loose) Pattern:** Simplest type, used for simple shapes or small production.
    *   **Split Pattern:** Made in two or more pieces to facilitate easy removal from the mold. Used for complex castings.
    *   **Match Plate Pattern:** A split pattern mounted on opposite sides of a single plate, ensuring accurate alignment. Used for higher volume production.
    *   **Cope and Drag Pattern:** Similar to match plate, but cope and drag halves are mounted on separate plates.
*   **Pattern materials:**
    *   **Wood:** Economical, easy to machine (e.g., Pine, Mahogany).
    *   **Metal:** Durable, good for high volume, good dimensional stability (e.g., Aluminum, Brass, Steel).
    *   **Plastic:** Good surface finish, moderate durability, light weight (e.g., Urethane, Epoxy).
    *   **Plaster:** For intricate shapes, low volume.
*   **Pattern allowances:** Modifications made to the pattern dimensions to compensate for various factors that affect the final casting size and shape.
    *   **Shrinkage (Contraction) Allowance:** To compensate for the metal's contraction during solidification and cooling. (Pattern is made slightly larger).
    *   **Machining (Finish) Allowance:** Extra material added to surfaces that will be machined later to achieve desired accuracy and surface finish.
    *   **Draft (Taper) Allowance:** A slight taper provided on vertical surfaces of the pattern to facilitate easy removal from the mold without damaging the mold cavity.
    *   **Distortion Allowance:** For castings prone to warping during cooling (e.g., long, thin sections), the pattern might be intentionally distorted to counteract the expected warpage.
    *   **Shake Allowance:** A small clearance added to the pattern dimensions to account for the slight enlargement of the mold cavity when the pattern is shaken for removal.
*   **Types of Moulding sand and their Properties:**
    *   **Green Sand:** A mixture of silica sand, clay (binder), and water. Most common and economical.
    *   **Dry Sand:** Green sand molds that are baked to remove moisture, increasing strength and rigidity.
    *   **Loam Sand:** A mixture of sand and clay in equal proportions, used for very large and heavy castings.
    *   **Shell Sand:** Resin-coated sand used for shell molding, producing molds with excellent surface finish and dimensional accuracy.
    *   **Properties of Moulding Sand:**
        *   **Refractoriness:** Ability to withstand high temperatures of molten metal without fusing.
        *   **Permeability:** Ability to allow gases (generated during pouring) to escape through the mold.
        *   **Cohesiveness (Strength):** Ability of sand grains to stick together to retain the mold shape.
        *   **Collapsibility:** Ability of the sand to collapse after solidification, allowing free contraction of the casting and easy removal.
        *   **Flowability:** Ability of sand to flow and compact uniformly around the pattern.
*   **Core making:** Cores are separate sand shapes placed in the mold cavity to form internal passages or features that cannot be created by the pattern alone. Cores are typically made from special sand mixtures that provide high strength at elevated temperatures.
*   **Elements of gating system:** A network of channels through which molten metal flows from the ladle into the mold cavity.
    *   **Pouring Basin:** A funnel-shaped reservoir at the top of the mold for receiving molten metal.
    *   **Sprue:** A vertical channel connecting the pouring basin to the runner.
    *   **Runner:** Horizontal channels that distribute molten metal from the sprue to the ingates.
    *   **Gate (Ingate):** The entry point into the mold cavity.
    *   **Riser:** A reservoir of molten metal that feeds the casting as it shrinks during solidification, preventing shrinkage defects.
*   **Description and operation of cupola:** A cupola is a vertical shaft furnace used for melting cast iron, and sometimes bronze. It consists of a steel shell lined with refractory bricks. Fuel (coke), metal, and flux (limestone) are charged from the top. Air is blown in from the bottom through tuyeres, burning the coke and melting the metal. Molten metal collects at the bottom and is tapped out.

### Working principle of Special casting processes
*   **Shell casting:** A casting process that uses a thin, hard shell mold made from a mixture of sand and thermosetting resin.
    *   **Principle:** A metal pattern is heated, coated with a resin-sand mixture, which forms a shell around the pattern. The shell is cured (hardened) by heating, and then the two halves are clamped together to form the mold. Molten metal is poured into the shell mold.
*   **Pressure die casting:** A metal casting process that is characterized by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity.
    *   **Principle:** Molten metal is injected under high pressure into a steel die cavity. After solidification, the die opens, and the casting is ejected.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **Hot-chamber die casting:** Melting furnace is an integral part of the machine, metal is injected directly into the die. Used for low melting point metals (zinc, lead, tin).
        *   **Cold-chamber die casting:** Molten metal is ladled from a separate furnace into a shot chamber, then injected into the die. Used for high melting point metals (aluminum, brass, magnesium).
*   **Centrifugal casting:** A casting process that uses centrifugal force to distribute molten metal into a mold.
    *   **Principle:** Molten metal is poured into a rotating mold. The centrifugal force pushes the molten metal against the mold wall, forming a dense, uniform casting.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **True centrifugal casting:** Used for producing cylindrical parts (pipes, tubes) with a hollow interior without using a core. The mold rotates around its own axis.
        *   **Semi-centrifugal casting:** Used for producing solid or spoked parts (wheels, pulleys) where a central core may be used. The mold rotates about a central vertical axis.
        *   **Vertical centrifugal casting:** For shorter parts, the mold rotates on a vertical axis.
*   **Casting defects:** Irregularities that occur during the metal casting process, impacting quality or performance.
    *   **1. Gas Porosity Defects:** Tiny holes or bubbles inside or on the casting's surface.
        *   **Specific Defects:** Blowholes, pinholes, subsurface blowholes.

        *   **Remedies:** Optimize structural design for uniform wall thickness, increase riser efficiency, use chills, control cooling rates, improve gating/risering.
    *   **3. Pouring Metal Defects:** Issues arising during the pouring of molten metal into the mold.
        *   **Specific Defects:** Misruns, cold shuts, slag inclusion, dross, cold shots, incomplete fill.
        *   **Causes:** Low pouring temperature, poor metal fluidity, improper gating system, oxidation, contamination.
        *   **Remedies:** Increase metal/mold temperature, optimize gating system, improve metal fluidity, deoxidation treatments, control pouring temperature/speed, ensure material purity.
    *   **4. Mold Material Defects:** Defects related to the mold itself.
        *   **Specific Defects:** Sand inclusion, sand hole, mold shift, drops, swells, mold cracking.
        *   **Causes:** Poor mold design, inadequate venting, erosion of mold material, low green strength/hardness of sand, excessive moisture, misalignment of mold halves.

        *   **Remedies:** Proper mold alignment, design, and handling; replace worn parts; ensure even sand ramming.

## Unit II: Joining Processes

### Joining Processes
**Definition:** Joining processes are manufacturing methods used to permanently combine two or more separate parts into a single assembly.

*   **Welding principles:** Welding is a fabrication process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing coalescence. This is often done by melting the workpiece materials and adding a filler material to form a pool of molten material that cools to form a strong joint, with pressure sometimes used in conjunction with heat, or by itself.
*   **Classification of welding processes:**
    *   **Fusion Welding:** Materials are joined by melting them together, often with a filler metal (e.g., Arc welding, Gas welding).
    *   **Resistance Welding:** Heat is generated by electrical resistance at the interface of workpieces held under pressure (e.g., Spot welding, Seam welding).
    *   **Solid-State Welding:** Materials are joined without melting, by applying pressure at room or elevated temperatures (e.g., Friction welding, Diffusion welding).
*   **Fusion welding:** A classification of welding processes where two or more parts are joined by melting them together and often adding a filler metal to the joint.
*   **Gas welding:** A fusion welding process that uses a flame produced by the combustion of a fuel gas (e.g., acetylene) and oxygen to melt the workpieces and filler metal.
    *   **Equipments used (Oxy-acetylene):** Oxygen cylinder, acetylene cylinder, pressure regulators, hoses, welding torch, filler rods, flux, goggles.
    *   **Filler and Flux materials:**
        *   **Filler Materials:** Wires or rods of a specific composition added to the weld pool to provide additional material and improve joint strength.
        *   **Flux Materials:** Chemical compounds applied to the joint or filler rod to clean the metal surfaces, prevent oxidation, stabilize the arc, and protect the molten weld pool from atmospheric contamination.
*   **Electric arc welding:** A fusion welding process that uses an electric arc to create heat for melting and joining metals.
*   **Gas metal arc welding (MIG):** (Metal Inert Gas) also known as GMAW, uses a continuously fed, consumable wire electrode.
    *   **Principle:** An electric arc forms between the continuously fed wire electrode and the workpiece. The wire melts and becomes the filler material. A shielding gas (e.g., Argon + CO2 blend) protects the weld pool.
    *   **Characteristics:** Consumable wire electrode, easier and faster to learn, high production rates, good for thicker materials, industrial applications, less aesthetic welds.
*   **Submerged arc welding:** An arc welding process where the arc is shielded by a blanket of granular fusible flux. The arc and weld pool are not visible during welding.
    *   **Principle:** A bare wire electrode is continuously fed, and the arc is maintained beneath a layer of flux. The flux melts to form a protective slag and adds alloying elements.
*   **Electro slag welding:** A highly productive, single-pass welding process for thick materials in a vertical or near-vertical position.
    *   **Principle:** An electric arc melts a consumable electrode and flux to form a molten slag pool. The resistance heating of the slag then melts the filler wire and edges of the workpieces, allowing them to fuse.
*   **TIG and MIG welding process:**
    *   **TIG Welding (Tungsten Inert Gas) / GTAW:** Uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode.
        *   **Principle:** An electric arc is created between a non-consumable tungsten electrode and the workpiece. A separate filler rod is typically added manually. An inert shielding gas (e.g., pure Argon) protects the arc and weld pool.
        *   **Characteristics:** Non-consumable tungsten electrode, requires significant skill, slower, excellent for thin/delicate materials, high precision and aesthetic welds, aerospace/automotive applications, stronger welds with fewer defects.
    *   **MIG Welding (Metal Inert Gas) / GMAW:**
        *   **Principle:** An electric arc forms between a continuously fed consumable wire electrode and the workpiece. The wire melts to become filler material. A shielding gas (Argon + CO2) protects the weld pool.
        *   **Characteristics:** Consumable wire, easier to learn, faster, good for thicker materials, general manufacturing/construction, less aesthetic welds.
*   **Resistance welding:** A group of welding processes that produce coalescence of workpieces by the heat obtained from resistance to electric current flow through the workpieces held together under pressure.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **Spot Welding:** Joins overlapping sheets at small, localized spots using two electrodes.
        *   **Seam Welding:** Produces a continuous weld by overlapping spot welds using rotating wheel electrodes.

    *   **2. Porosity:** Gas pockets or voids within the weld metal due to trapped gases during solidification. Can be localized, linear, or wormholes.
        *   **Causes:** Contamination (dirt, grease, moisture), inadequate/incorrect shielding gas, inadequate electrode coating, too high arc voltage/long arc length.
        *   **Remedies:** Thoroughly clean base metal, ensure proper shielding gas flow/purity, use dry electrodes, maintain short/stable arc length, optimize welding parameters.
    *   **3. Undercut:** A groove melted into the base metal adjacent to the weld toe or root, left unfilled.

        *   **Remedies:** Reduce current/travel speed, correct electrode angle, avoid long arc length, appropriate electrode size, use weaving techniques.
    *   **4. Lack of Fusion / Incomplete Penetration:**
        *   **Lack of Fusion:** No proper bond between weld metal and parent metal, or between weld beads.
        *   **Incomplete Penetration:** Weld metal fails to fuse completely through the joint thickness.
        *   **Causes:** Low heat input/welding current, excessive travel speed, incorrect electrode angle/diameter, contaminated surfaces, too small root gap.
        *   **Remedies:** Increase current, reduce travel speed, wider root gap, clean metal, suitable electrode/wire diameter, correct electrode angle.

## Unit III: Deformation Processes

### Deformation Processes
**Definition:** Deformation processes (or forming processes) are manufacturing methods that involve shaping metallic workpieces by subjecting them to stresses that exceed the yield strength but are below the fracture strength, causing permanent (plastic) deformation.

*   **Hot working and cold working of metals:**
    *   **Hot Working:** Shaping metals at temperatures *above* their recrystallization temperature. Metal is more ductile, less force is needed. Grain structure is refined. Poor surface finish and lower dimensional accuracy due to oxidation and shrinkage. Examples: hot rolling, hot forging.
    *   **Cold Working:** Shaping metals at temperatures *below* their recrystallization temperature (typically room temperature). Increases strength and hardness (strain hardening) but reduces ductility. Requires higher forces. Better surface finish and dimensional accuracy. Examples: cold rolling, bending, wire drawing.
*   **Forging processes:** Deformation process where metal is shaped by compressive forces applied through dies.
*   **Open and closed die forging process:**
    *   **Open Die Forging:** Metal is shaped between flat or simple contour dies; workpiece is not fully enclosed. Highly flexible, suitable for large/custom parts, low volume. Lower tooling costs. Poor precision and surface finish, lower production rate.
    *   **Closed Die Forging (Impression Die Forging):** Metal is completely or mostly enclosed within dies containing detailed impressions. Achieves tighter tolerances, better surface finish, complex shapes. High strength due to grain flow. Cost-effective for high-volume production, but high initial tooling costs.
*   **Typical forging operations:**
    *   **Upsetting:** Increasing the cross-section of a workpiece by shortening its length through compression.
    *   **Drawing out:** Decreasing the cross-section of a workpiece by lengthening it.
    *   **Bending:** Forming a straight section into a curved shape.
    *   **Punching:** Creating a hole in a workpiece by shearing out a slug of material.
    *   **Trimming:** Removing excess material (flash) from a forged part.
*   **Rolling of metals:** A deformation process where metal stock is passed through one or more pairs of rolls to reduce its thickness, make it uniform, and/or to impart a desired mechanical property.
    *   **Principle:** Compressive forces from rotating rolls deform the metal, reducing its thickness and increasing its length.
    *   **Types:** Hot rolling (above recrystallization temp), Cold rolling (below recrystallization temp).
*   **Principle of rod and wire drawing:** Process of reducing the cross-section of a rod or wire by pulling it through a series of dies.
    *   **Principle:** Tensile force pulls the metal through a die with a converging section, reducing its diameter and increasing its length.
*   **Tube drawing:** Process similar to wire drawing, but applied to tubes to reduce their diameter and/or wall thickness.
    *   **Principle:** A tube is pulled through a die, often with an internal mandrel to control the inner diameter and wall thickness.
*   **Principle of Extrusion:** A process where a material is pushed or drawn through a die of a desired cross-section.
    *   **Principle:** A ram applies compressive force to a billet, forcing it through a die opening to create a long product with a uniform cross-section.
*   **Types of Extrusion:**
    *   **Forward/Direct Extrusion:** The billet is placed in a container and forced through a die at the opposite end.
    *   **Backward/Indirect Extrusion:** The die is mounted on a hollow ram that moves into the stationary billet, forcing the material to flow backward around the ram.
    *   **Hydrostatic Extrusion:** The billet is surrounded by a pressurized fluid, which transmits the force from the ram to the billet, reducing friction and allowing for more uniform deformation.
*   **Hot and Cold extrusion:** Extrusion can be performed as hot working (for larger reductions, lower forces) or cold working (for better precision, surface finish, and strength).

### Sheet metal characteristics
*   **Sheet metal characteristics:** Properties crucial for forming operations, including:
    *   **Ductility:** Ability to deform plastically under tensile stress without fracturing (e.g., in deep drawing).
    *   **Formability:** The ease with which a sheet metal can be shaped without tearing or wrinkling.
    *   **Strength:** Resistance to deformation under applied stress.
    *   **Anisotropy:** Directional dependence of material properties due to prior working.
*   **Typical shearing operations:** Processes where a punch and die are used to cut sheet metal.
    *   **Punching:** Cutting out a piece of material (slug) from a larger sheet, leaving a hole. The slug is waste.
    *   **Blanking:** Cutting out a desired component (blank) from a larger sheet. The surrounding material is waste.
    *   **Piercing:** General term for punching holes.
    *   **Notching:** Removing a small portion of material from the edge of a sheet.
    *   **Trimming:** Removing excess material from the periphery of a part, often after a forming operation.
*   **Bending and drawing operations:**
    *   **Bending:** Deforming sheet metal around a straight axis to create an angle.
    *   **Drawing (Deep Drawing):** A sheet metal forming process in which a sheet metal blank is radially drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch. Used to make cup-shaped or cylindrical parts.
*   **Stretch forming operations:** A sheet metal forming process in which the sheet metal is simultaneously stretched and bent over a die.
    *   **Principle:** The sheet is gripped along its edges and stretched over a form block or die. As it stretches, it conforms to the die's shape.
*   **Metal spinning:** A forming process in which a flat sheet metal disc, held against a rotating mandrel (form block), is gradually shaped by a tool applying pressure.
    *   **Principle:** A rotating flat metal disk is plastically deformed over a rotating male form (mandrel) using a rounded tool, progressively shaping the metal into an axially symmetric part.

    *   **CNC Routers (Computer Numerical Control):** Automated machines that precisely control the router's movement based on computer programming, enabling complex and repetitive cuts.
*   **History:** Manual routing tools have existed for centuries. The electric handheld router was invented in the early 20th century. CNC routing emerged with the advent of computer automation in manufacturing.
*   **3D Modeling software:** For CNC wood routing, 3D modeling software (e.g., Fusion 360, VCarve Pro, Aspire) is used to design the 3D shapes or tool paths. For simpler 2D cuts, vector graphics software can be used.
*   **Creation of compatible file format for Wood Routing:**
    *   **G-code:** The most common programming language for CNC machines, which defines the tool's movements, speeds, and other operations.
    *   **DXF (Drawing Exchange Format):** For 2D vector profiles.
    *   **STL:** For complex 3D surfaces, which can then be converted into G-code by CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) software.
    *   **Proprietary formats:** Specific software often has its own file types for projects.
