# Press Working

> Press working is a chipless manufacturing process used to produce components from sheet metal. A machine called a press is used to apply force to shear or form the material, typically in a cold state.

## Press Working Operations

Press working operations can be broadly categorized into two main types:

| Category            | Description                                                                                             | Examples                                                              |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cutting Operations**  | The workpiece is stressed beyond its ultimate shear strength, causing the material to be cut or separated. | Punching, Blanking, Notching, Trimming, Shearing, Nibbling, Parting.  |
| **Forming Operations**  | Stresses are applied below the ultimate shear strength, changing the contour of the workpiece without cutting. | Bending, Embossing, Coining, Upsetting, Swaging, Deep Drawing.        |

## Press Working Cutting Operations

### Mechanism of Shearing
When a force is applied by a punch onto a sheet metal piece over a die, the metal experiences shear stresses. As the force increases to a value greater than the ultimate shear strength of the material, shearing and cracking begin at the edges of the punch and die. These cracks propagate towards each other, causing the piece to separate from the sheet. The fundamental mechanism is **Shearing and Tearing**.

### Common Cutting Operations

| Operation | Description | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Punching** | The cutting action produces a hole in the sheet. | The material removed (the "slug") is scrap, and the hole is the desired feature. |
| **Blanking** | The cutting action produces a piece from the sheet. | The piece removed is the desired workpiece (the "blank"). |

- **Notching:** An operation that cuts metal pieces from the **edge** of a sheet or blank.
- **Perforating:** An operation that punches **multiple** small holes in sheet metal.
- **Trimming:** A process for removing unwanted or excess material from the surface or edge of a workpiece.
- **Shaving:** The process of removing a thin strip of metal from a blanked part to improve the edge finish and dimensional accuracy.
- **Slitting:** An operation of making incomplete holes or cuts in a workpiece.
- **Lancing:** A piercing operation where the workpiece is sheared and bent in a single strike. No material is removed, but a feature (like a tab or vent) is created.
- **Nibbling:** A process that cuts a contour by producing a series of overlapping slits or notches, allowing for complex shapes to be formed without a dedicated die.

## Press Working Forming Operations

### Deep Drawing
A sheet forming operation where a sheet metal blank is placed over a die opening and pushed by a punch into the opening. This process is mainly used for producing cup-shaped components, like kitchen utensils.

**Key Aspects:**
- A **blank holder** is used to hold the sheet flat on the die surface to prevent wrinkling.
- The **Blank Holder Force (BHF)** is critical: if too low, wrinkling occurs; if too high, it prevents the sheet from flowing and causes tearing. The optimal BHF is about one-third of the drawing force.
- The final cup will have some **thinning** in the side walls.

### Embossing
A process where impressions are made on sheet metal such that the sheet thickness remains uniform. A raised design on one side of the sheet corresponds to a depression on the other side.

### Bending
A forming operation where a sheet metal is subjected to bending stress, causing a flat sheet to be formed into a curved or angled shape.
- **V-bending:** Uses a V-shaped die and punch.
- **Edge bending:** One end of the sheet is held like a cantilever while a punch bends the other end.

### Swaging
Used to reduce the diameter of a tube or rod at the end of the workpiece to create a tapered section. This is often done by means of rotating dies that hammer the workpiece in a radial direction.

### Upsetting
A deformation operation in which a cylindrical workpiece's diameter is increased while its length is reduced. It is a type of closed-die forging and is widely used in the fastener industry to form heads on nails, bolts, and similar products.

## Presses and Tooling

### Types of Presses
- **Hydraulic Presses:** Derive their energy from hydraulic pressure. They are powerful and can operate over a long distance at a constant speed but are generally slower than mechanical presses.
- **Mechanical Presses:** Transform the rotational force of a motor into a translational force. They are generally faster than hydraulic presses, but the force application varies in speed and magnitude throughout the stroke.

### Die Set
The tools used in press working consist of a **punch** (male part) and a **die** (female part). The complete assembly of these components is called a **die set**.

**Main Components of a Die:**
- **Die Block:** The female part of the die, which contains the cavity.
- **Die Holder:** Mounts and supports the die block on the press bed.
- **Punch:** The male part of the assembly that is fastened to the press ram and performs the forming or cutting action.
- **Punch Plate:** Holds the punch.
- **Stripper Plate:** Used to strip the sheet metal off the punch after the operation.
- **Guide Pins:** Align the upper and lower halves of the die set for accurate operation.
- **Back-up Plate:** A pressure plate that distributes the pressure over a wider area.

## Strip Layout
The optimal arrangement of blanks on a sheet or strip to maximize material utilization and minimize waste.
- **Scrap Bridge:** The distance between blanks, or between a blank and the edge of the strip. It must be sufficient to prevent the scrap from twisting and to strengthen the strip during feeding.

### Types of Strip Layout
- **Single Row, Single Pass:** Blanks are arranged in a single row and punched in one pass.
  - **Wide Run:** The component's length is aligned with the strip's width. This results in a shorter pitch and faster production.
  - **Narrow Run:** Used when the grain direction of the material is important.
- **Single Row, Double Pass:** The strip is fed through the tool twice to achieve greater material economy.
- **Double Row, Double Pass:** A wider strip is used with blanks arranged in two rows, fed twice for even higher economy.
- **Angular Layout:** Blanks are positioned at an angle on the strip, which can be more economical depending on the component's shape.
