# Metal Forming

> Metal forming is a manufacturing process where a metal is plastically deformed by a force that exceeds the material's yield strength. For successful forming, the material should have low yield strength and high ductility. Increasing the temperature reduces yield strength and increases ductility, making deformation easier.

## Classification of Metal Forming Processes

### Bulk Forming
A severe deformation process resulting in a massive shape change, characterized by a small surface-area-to-volume ratio. These processes are mostly done under hot working conditions.

**Basic bulk deformation processes include:**
- Rolling
- Forging
- Extrusion
- Drawing
- Spinning

## Bulk Forming Processes

### Rolling
A process where the thickness of the work is reduced by compressive forces from two rolls rotating in opposite directions.
- **Flat rolling:** Reduces the thickness of a rectangular cross-section.
- **Shape rolling:** Forms a cross-section into a shape like an I-beam.

#### Starting Materials for Rolling
- **Bloom:** Square cross-section (150mm x 150mm or more). Rolled into structural shapes like railroad tracks.
- **Slab:** Rectangular cross-section (250mm width or more, 40mm thickness or more). Rolled into plates, sheets, and strips.
- **Billet:** Square cross-section (40mm on a side or more). Rolled into bars and rods, which serve as raw materials for other processes like machining, wire drawing, and forging.

### Forging
A deformation process where the workpiece is compressed between two dies, using either an impact load or a gradual hydraulic load. It is used to make high-strength components for automotive, aerospace, and other applications.

#### Types of Forging
- **Open die forging:** The workpiece is compressed between two flat dies, allowing the metal to flow without restriction.
- **Impression die forging:** The die surfaces contain a shape that is imparted to the workpiece. This restricts metal flow, and some excess material, called **flash**, flows out of the die impression. The flash is trimmed off later.
- **Flashless forging:** The workpiece is fully restricted within the die, and no flash is produced. The initial workpiece volume must be accurately controlled to match the die cavity volume.

### Extrusion
A bulk forming process where the work metal is forced to flow through a die hole to produce a desired cross-sectional shape (e.g., squeezing toothpaste from a tube).

#### Types of Extrusion
- **Direct extrusion:** A metal billet is forced through a die opening by a ram. Significant friction exists between the billet surface and the container walls.
- **Indirect extrusion:** The die is mounted on the ram, and as the ram compresses the metal, it flows through the die in a direction opposite to the ram's motion. With no relative motion between the billet and the container, friction is lower, and thus the required ram force is lower.

### Wire and Bar Drawing
A process where a wire, rod, or bar is pulled through a die hole to reduce its cross-sectional area.
- **Bar drawing:** For large diameter bars and rods. It is generally a single-stage batch operation.
- **Wire drawing:** For small diameter stock. Wire is drawn through a series of dies (typically 4 to 12) in a continuous process.

### Tube Drawing
An operation used to reduce the diameter or wall thickness of seamless tubes and pipes.
- **Tube sinking:** Uses no mandrel and is used for diameter reduction only. The inside diameter and wall thickness are not controlled.
- **Drawing with a mandrel:** A mandrel is required to control both the inside diameter and wall thickness.

## Sheet Metal Forming Processes

### Spinning
A sheet metal forming process where a metal blank is pressed over a rotating chuck or form mandrel with a pressing tool to obtain an axisymmetric hollow shell. It is often used for large parts or when only a small number of parts are needed.

#### Types of Spinning
- **Hot Spinning:** The metal blank is heated to forging temperature before forming. Generally used for thicker plates and sheets.
- **Cold Spinning:** The metal blank is worked at room temperature. Best suited for thin plates and sheets of aluminum and other soft metals.

#### Advantages of Spinning
- Economical for small batches.
- Well-suited for large parts.
- Can produce complex shapes that are not feasible with drawing.
- No investment in die making is required.

#### Limitations of Spinning
- More time-consuming than drawing.
- Requires a more skilled operator.
- Not suitable for large-scale production.

### Die Stamping
A cold-forming process that uses dies and stamping presses to transform sheet metal into different shapes. It is a low-cost, high-speed manufacturing process.

#### Stamping Processes Include:
- **Punching and Blanking:** Using a die to cut material. Punching creates a hole by removing a scrap piece. Blanking removes a workpiece from the primary material.
- **Embossing:** Creating a raised or recessed design in sheet metal.
- **Coining:** A bending technique where the workpiece is stamped between a die and a punch, causing the punch tip to penetrate the metal for accurate, repeatable bends.
- **Bending:** Forming metal into desired shapes such as L, U, or V-shaped profiles.
- **Flanging:** Introducing a flare or flange onto a metal workpiece.
